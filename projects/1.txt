b:T4f6,NYSeeNow is a web and mobile application that aides tourists or residents navigate the bustling attractions in Manhattan, New York. We aid the user by providing accurate real-time busyness predictions. The objectives of this project are to enhance the overall tourist experience, optimise travel planning, and alleviate congestion at popular attractions. To achieve these goals, we adopted a combination of methodologies such as machine learning algorithms, data mining techniques, and more to analyse and utilise taxi and subway data, weather conditions, and other factors, in order to accurately calculate and predict busyness. While developing the application, we focused on a user-centric design, incorporating several UX design principles. The project was developed by a six-member team who used the scrum methodology to manage the development process. The key findings of this project demonstrate that NYSeeNow successfully predicts the busyness of Manhattan’s tourist attractions, enabling users to plan their visits strategically and optimise their stay in Manhattan. The application’s seamless integration of data science and pertinent information provides tourists with personalised itineraries and insights, enhancing their overall experience in the city.c:T44e, I played a critical role in deploying our application. Initially, I utilized three EC2 servers with Jenkins, each assigned to handle the back end, front end, and Flask micro-service components. This approach proved to be inefficient, especially in setting up connections. To optimize deployment, I collaborated closely with the front-end code lead. Together, we decided to leverage Docker to containerize our application, enhancing its deployment efficiency. During the final phase of deployment, I decided to use Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic to different back end services while exposing only port 80 for the front end. With Nginx, we can effectively test and use our Spring Boot and Flask back ends without exposing their specific ports to the external world. So I built separate Docker images for each part (front end, Spring Boot back end, Flask back end) and a fourth Docker image for Nginx. This setup ensures that each component of our application (including the reverse proxy) is containerized, making it easier to manage, scale, or replace parts of your infrastructure as needed.3:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__variable_aa4d39 font-inter antialiased bg-white text-gray-900
